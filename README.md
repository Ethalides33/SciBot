# SciBot (WIP)
Discord bot that allows users to look for scientific articles (currently, only those from Nature) from discord. It displays various information on the articles found. It also implements a "hot topic" command, which looks for the most popular recent scientific articles, similar to a scientific newsteller. ALso, it can say hello in most languages (yes, it is useless).
